## Fantasy Football Trade Value Calculator

Welcome to the **Fantasy Football Trade Value Calculator** â€“ a tool dedicated to fantasy football enthusiasts that aims to evaluate and compare the trade value of players based on projected fantasy points.

### Project Structure:
- `ff_scraper.py`: Contains functions and logic to scrape and process player data from CBS Sports.
- `ff_gui.py`: Houses the GUI implementation for the tool using `tkinter`.
- `team_fantasy_points.csv`: A CSV file storing DST player names along with their respective projected fantasy points, due to scraping constraints.
- `README.md`: An informative guide about the tool and how to use it.

### Key Features:

1. **Data Acquisition and Integration**:
    - Player data is sourced from CBS Sports, specifically URLs like [CBS Sports QB Projections](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/stats/QB/2023/season/projections/nonppr/) and others.
    - While data from most positions is scraped directly, DST data posed challenges. As a result, we reference it from the `team_fantasy_points.csv` for integration and usage.
    - Columns in the CSV are `Player` and `PlayerValue` to ensure efficient referencing within the codebase.

2. **User-friendly GUI**:
    - Built using the `tkinter` library, the GUI is intuitive and straightforward.
    - "Team A" and "Team B" list boxes let users select players for a potential trade.
    - Efficient player searching is facilitated with search bars above each list box.
    - Upon clicking the "Evaluate" button, the application computes total fantasy points for the selected players and provides a value-based evaluation of the trade.
    - The "Clear Selections" button allows for starting over, and with the "Trade History" button, users can review their past evaluations, which also showcases a graphical representation using `matplotlib` for in-depth insights.
